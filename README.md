# Reddit Clone

To setup:

**1.** Setup Ruby and Download the Rails Gem

**2.** Clone the repo

**3.** In the folder, run `bundle install`, then `rails server`

**4.** Open it in your web browser (by default this is at `localhost:3000`)

* To add users go to /users

* To add subreddits go to /subreddits

* To add posts go to /posts

* To add comments go to /comments

### The above will change eventually to a proper system, right now it's just the default system that's generated when you create Rails scaffolding

### The proper intended front-end view is at /view (eg. view subreddits at /view/subreddits, etc.)
